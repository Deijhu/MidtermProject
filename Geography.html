                        <p>The Piddig is a third-class municipality situated along the rolling hills between the Guisit and Dingris rivers. It has a total land area of 21,620 hectares, of which, 5,712 hectares are agricultural lands, while about 14,000 hectares are forest areas.
                   
                        Piddig has 23 barangays and a population of 21,497 residents. It is home to around 4,600 farmers whose primary crops are rice, corn, root crops, vegetables, fruits, and legumes. Other sources of livelihood for the community are fishery, livestock, and forestry.

                        Just a few years ago, Piddig, like other municipalities, had a less-than-stellar rice yield. Even before running for mayor, Eduardo “Eddie” Guillen had a vision for agricultural development, and ideas on how to roll it out. His parents, after all, are Piddig farmers.His first project failed. He initiated something big, but the smallholders were not receptive. It was only after he piloted a smaller project with the farmers, and after positive word-of-mouth, that smallholders became interested.

                        Mayor Guillen learned that agricultural projects can be scaled up through the resources of national government agencies. But first, the municipality needed to plan and consult its constituents.
                            
                        When they were sure about their development plan—that it was coherent and that it considered possible consequences—the mayor knocked on the doors of national government agencies to see what projects he can take home.
                            
                        Knocking on doors was not easy. Their development plan had no “proof of concept” at that time. Political alliances—Piddig being in Ilocos Norte—almost disqualified them from being heard. But he persevered, always carrying their development plan with him.

                        Being a civil engineer by profession, Mayor Guillen knew they needed a flood control dam, and had ideas on where it should be set up and how it can also be used as an irrigation facility.

                        <p> His ideas led him to an audience with the former secretary of the Department of Public Works and Highways. The flood control facility was the first of many projects he was able to bring in his municipality.

                        As Mayor Guillen kept knocking, he was answered by the Department of Agriculture, which provided them with a rice processing center and farm machines and equipment. When he knocked at the Department of Environment and Natural Resources, it used the National Greening Program to start coffee production in Piddig. Now smallholders are provided diversified income.
                            
                        The municipal government of Piddig converged the national projects
                        The operationalization of the national convergence initiative (and now, with the whole-of-nation approach) is with local governments. Projects do not converge on their own. They need an orchestrator. Mayor Guillen worked to ensure that the projects he sought fit well.
