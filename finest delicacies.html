                        <p>The “Saluyots” of the North
                            In early days, the Tagalogs used to call the people of Ilocos the “Saluyots,” after the leafy vegetables. Far from being derogatory, the nickname was coined out of grudging respect for a people who had turned what was considered in the south as mere weed into a dish.
                            Vegetables dishes are present at the table at any given time. Farmers will eat inabraw (also called dinengdeng), a streaming broth made of leafy green vegetables, before heading off for the fields in the morning and likewise, upon returning home at sundown.</p></td>

                    <p>The ingenuous Ilocano can come up with various dishes during the rainy season, the rabong or bamboo shoot can be served as is (sliced finely and seasoned with fish paste, vinegar, garlic and black pepper) or as inabraw (oftentimes combined with saluyot). Rabong omelettes, croquettes and fried balls are also common. The linukotis, a kind of fried lumpia made from bamboo shoots and clam meat, is also popular. <br>

                    Mushroom dishes are also common. Uong ken laplapayag is a stew of native mushrooms, black ear mushrooms and tofu. In the town of Bacarra, a flesh-colored mushroom called kuditdit is cooked with fish paste, string beans and banana heart.  <br>
                        
                    Squash is used as the main ingredient for making variations of lumpia or embutido. Its flower, meanwhile, is made into a cold stew of eggs and cake flour. An unlikely culinary item is the unassuming banana blossom, which is mixed with shrimp, ground pork and beaten egg to make fried flour sticks. <br>
                        
                    In general, vegetable dishes can be grouped into the simple and the elaborate. <br>
                        
                    Ilocanos are not finicky eaters. Eggplant, ampalaya (bitter gourd) or okra are sometimes just broiled and eaten with a dip made of fish paste and vinegar or calamansi. Salutoys is often prepared as matimtim, cooked in vinegar, water, fish paste, garlic and salt. Vegetables like saluyot and okra are favored for their slimy textures. <br>
                        
                    They also have different kinds of salads. Ampalaya leaves, squasjh tops, eel grass, pipino, pako (fern), kangkong, kulot (a kind of sewed), pallang (winged bean), string bean, marunggay leaves, susop (banana blossom) and camote (a kind of rootcrop) tops are just some of the vegetables they use for salads. These are mixed with ginger, onions, vinegar, black pepper, calamansi, fish sauce and fish paste, and garnished with tomatoes. <br>
                        
                    The aforementioned inabraw is the generic term for vegetables stew. The vegetable of choice is mixed with tomatoes, ginger and the ever-present bagoong or fish paste. Sometimes, shrimp or broiled fish is also added to liven up the taste. The more exciting  inabraw varieties are the ones with the marunggay fruit (one opens the tough skin and scrapes the soft pulp inside) and the rabong shoots and the saluyot, with its distinct slimy/crunchy texture. <br>
                        
                    The combination of contrasting tastes, flavors and textures make Ilocano vegetable dishes the most exciting in the whole country. It is thus not surprising that the most important contribution of the Ilocanos to Filipino cuisine is the pinakbet. <br>
                        
                    The name is derived from the term “pinakebbet,” which means “to shrink.” It is primarily an assorted vegetable dish. Contrary to popular belief, there is no singular pinakbet dish. The common one uses the most number of vegetable ingredient, including eggplant, ampalaya, okra, stringbeans, patani, lima beans and rabanos. <br>
                        
                    In most places, pieces of fish or meat are added as sagpaw or garnishing. The most common sagpaw is bagnet (fried pork rind or meat) which adds crunchiness. However, there are places such as Pagudpud, where pinakbet is made solely with vegetables. <br>
                        
                    Pinakbet is not pinakbet without ampalaya or bagoong. These two ingredients best define the inclinations of the Ilocano palate. This particular clash of extreme tastes, the bitter and the salty, is not to be found elsewhere in the country.</p></td>
